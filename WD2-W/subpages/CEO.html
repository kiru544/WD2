          <p class="C">
            Hi, my name is David Iming and I started Flash Imagery ten years
            ago. I am a Brisbane boy specialising in fashion, advertising,
            portraiture and weddings. After developing a keen interest in
            photography in early secondary school I went to train in Melbourne
            at what is considered to be the premier college of its type in
            Australia â€“ Photographic Studies College in Southbank. Technical
            ability is just part of the puzzle and I am extremely proud of not
            only the skill that each of our photographers possess, but also
            their ability to connect with clients, models, subjects and audience
            alike to make each of them the complete photographer and a perfect
            choice for your project.
